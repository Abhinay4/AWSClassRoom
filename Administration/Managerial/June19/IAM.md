## Excercise
1. Create a user with <any name> and give him administrator access (AWS Managed Policy)
2. Create another user with <any name> and give him EC2 Readonly policy
3. Play around with AWS Console by logging in as two users
4. Above mentioned access policies are around services not resources.

## Steps For effective Policy Writing
1. Get Familiar with [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
